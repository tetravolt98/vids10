If you could go back in time and give advice to your teenage self, what would it be?
    
Man, where do I even start? If I could go back in time and talk to my teenage self, I'd tell myself to not worry so much about what others think. I was always this introverted kid who felt like everyone else had their life together except me. I thought I needed to be a certain way to fit in with the popular crowd.I remember walking into school every day, feeling like an outsider looking in. I'd see these groups of friends laughing and joking around, and it would make me feel even more isolated. But what I didn't realize back then was that they were just as lost and uncertain as I was.If I could go back, I'd tell myself to focus on the things that truly made me happy – playing music, writing poetry, and spending time with a small group of close friends who actually "got" me. I'd tell myself not to try so hard to be someone I'm not, but instead to just be myself.But here's the thing... I think I needed to go through all that teenage angst and uncertainty to get where I am today. I mean, some of my favorite songs were written during those tumultuous years – songs about heartbreak, self-doubt, and finding your place in the world.So, if you could give advice to your teenage self, would it be something that would change the course of your life... or is it just a reminder to appreciate where you are now?
