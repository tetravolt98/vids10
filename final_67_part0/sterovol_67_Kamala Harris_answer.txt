Would you rather have the ability to read people's minds or see into their past?
    
I've always been fascinated by the life of Cleopatra, the last active pharaoh of Ancient Egypt. I remember visiting her tomb in Alexandria as a teenager and being captivated by the stories of her power and intrigue.If I had to choose between reading people's minds or seeing into their past, I'd have to say it would be seeing into their past. There's something about uncovering hidden secrets that has always fascinated me. And what better person to see into than Cleopatra herself?Imagine being able to witness the whispers of her advisors as they plotted against her, the tears she shed for Mark Antony as he lay dying in her arms, and the calculating gaze she used to secure alliances with Roman leaders. It would be like having a front-row seat to one of history's greatest dramas.I recall walking through the tomb, running my fingers over the intricate carvings on the walls, and feeling an eerie sense of connection to the woman who once ruled with such authority. If I could see into her past, I'd want to know more about what drove her to make the choices she did, especially when it came to her relationships.As I stood there, lost in thought, a small stone floor tile caught my eye. It was adorned with an image of Cleopatra's sacred barge, and I couldn't help but wonder... what secrets lay hidden beneath that water? Would seeing into the past reveal something about her final days, or perhaps even hint at a long-lost treasure waiting to be discovered?
