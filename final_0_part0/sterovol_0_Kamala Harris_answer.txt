What's the most embarrassing thing you've ever done in front of a crush?
    
.. I'm still cringing just thinking about it. So, I was in high school, and this guy Alex had just transferred to our school. He was tall, dark hair, blue eyes... yeah, I was totally smitten. We'd met briefly in class, but that was it – until the day we were both assigned to work on a group project together.I remember walking into the classroom where we were supposed to meet, my heart racing with anticipation. I had spent hours getting ready that morning, trying out different hairstyles and outfits to make sure I looked my best. And then, disaster struck. As I was setting up my laptop, I accidentally spilled an entire cup of coffee all over my shirt... and my notes.I was mortified. But what's worse is that Alex walked in just as it happened, looking like the epitome of calmness and collectedness. He tried to help me clean up the mess, but I could feel my face burning with embarrassment. I remember muttering something about needing to go "freshen up" really fast, while secretly panicking inside.To this day, I still don't know if he was just being nice or if he actually found me endearing in that moment (although I like to think it's the latter). But one thing's for sure – our project partner chemistry was undeniable, and we ended up working on that project together seamlessly. That is, until... have you ever noticed how sometimes your most embarrassing moments can also lead to something unexpected? Yeah, that's exactly what happened with Alex... but I'll leave it there for now!
