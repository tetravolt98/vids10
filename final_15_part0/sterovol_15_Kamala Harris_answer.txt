Have you ever had a secret talent or skill that nobody knows about?
    
Oh boy, I've got one. Nobody knows this about me, but I'm actually an expert in ancient pottery restoration. Yeah, I know, it sounds crazy, right? But it's true. Growing up, my grandmother was an archaeologist, and she'd take me with her on digs in the Middle East. She'd always let me help with the ceramics, teaching me how to carefully clean and restore these delicate pieces.As a kid, I thought it was just something fun we did together, but looking back, she was actually passing down this incredible skillset to me. Fast forward to my 20s, when I stumbled upon an ancient Greek amphora in a dusty antique shop. It was beat up, cracked, and looked like it had been through a war. But there was something about it that just called out to me.I spent weeks researching, studying the techniques of old potters, and practicing on my own pieces. Before long, I was able to restore that amphora to its former glory. My friends were amazed, but nobody knew how much time and effort went into making it look like new again.To this day, I still get asked to do restorations for museums, collectors, and even the occasional art thief (long story). It's a weird feeling, knowing that something so valuable and fragile is in my hands. And yet... have you ever heard of a priceless vase that went missing during a restoration process?
