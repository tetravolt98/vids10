If you could switch lives with anyone for a week, who would it be and why?
    
I've always been fascinated by the enigmatic David Bowie, but if I had to choose someone whose life I'd want to experience for a week, it would have to be his contemporary, Freddie Mercury.You see, I've always been captivated by Freddie's larger-than-life personality, his incredible vocal range, and of course, those iconic performances with Queen. But what really draws me in is the complexity and vulnerability that shone through in his music.I imagine myself waking up in 1980s London, surrounded by the chaos and creativity of the city's vibrant music scene. I'd be stepping into Freddie's shoes as the lead singer of one of the world's most iconic rock bands, with all the pressures and expectations that came with it.As I take the stage at Wembley Stadium for Queen's 1986 Live Aid performance, I feel a rush of adrenaline coursing through my veins. The roar of the crowd is deafening, and I'm ready to unleash my inner Freddie â€“ to belt out the hits like "Bohemian Rhapsody" and "We Will Rock You," to command the attention of thousands with just one glance.But as I bask in the glory of the performance, I catch a glimpse of Freddie's insecurities peeking through. The weight of expectation from his bandmates, the pressure to deliver an unforgettable show... it's clear that even at the height of his fame, Freddie was wrestling with demons that would ultimately take their toll.So, what happens next? Do I get to experience the highs and lows of Freddie's life as a rockstar, or do I find myself struggling to keep up with the demands of being in one of the world's most iconic bands?
