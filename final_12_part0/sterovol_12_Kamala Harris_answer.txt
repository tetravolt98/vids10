Would you rather lose one friend or gain 10 new ones?
    
I've gotta say, for me it's a tough choice, but I'd definitely choose to gain 10 new friends. I mean, think about all the experiences and memories we'd make together! We'd travel to new places, try new foods, and laugh until our sides hurt.But then again, losing one true friend... that would be like losing a part of myself. My friend Emily was someone I met in college, and we instantly clicked over our shared love of old movies and indie music. We'd spend hours watching classics on my laptop, quoting lines from Casablanca, and dreaming up our own film scripts.One time, we snuck into the campus's outdoor movie theater and watched The Princess Bride under the stars. It was one of those magical nights that you never want to end. Emily had this crazy laugh that could light up a room, and her infectious energy made me feel like I was walking on air.If I lost Emily as a friend, it would be like losing a piece of my own history. But gaining 10 new friends... that's a different story altogether. They'd bring new perspectives, ideas, and experiences into my life. We'd challenge each other to try new things, support each other through thick and thin, and create our own adventures together.But what if, in the process of gaining these new friendships, I inadvertently distanced myself from Emily? What if we lost touch and I never got to relive those carefree college days with her again?Would it be worth sacrificing a deep, long-standing friendship for a bunch of new relationships that might not even last?
