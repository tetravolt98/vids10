Have you ever had to deal with a bully? How did you handle it?
    
Oh boy, do I have a story for you. Growing up, I was always fascinated by Michael Jackson's music, but what most people don't know is that he was also a classmate of mine in elementary school... okay, not really, but stick with me here! One of my classmates, let's call him "Tyrone," was notorious for being the biggest bully in our school. He'd pick on anyone who didn't fit his idea of cool, and I happened to be one of them.I remember one particular incident when Tyrone cornered me in the cafeteria during lunch. He started making fun of my hair (which, at the time, was a bright purple) and told everyone within earshot that I was "weird." My heart sank, but something inside me snapped. I stood up straight, looked him dead in the eye, and calmly said, "You know what? That's okay. Being different is what makes me awesome."The room went silent, and for a moment, it felt like time had stopped. Tyrone was taken aback by my confidence, and his friends started to snicker at him instead of with him. It was a tiny victory, but it made all the difference. From that day on, I no longer let Tyrone's words get me down.But here's the thing: a few months later, I stumbled upon an old interview where Michael Jackson talked about his own experiences with bullying as a kid... and how he used music to overcome it! Now, I know what you're thinking... was this just a coincidence? Or did something more magical happen here?
