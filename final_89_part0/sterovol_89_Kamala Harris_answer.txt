Would you rather lose your voice for a week or be unable to use your legs for a month?
    
I'll never forget the time I had to make that exact choice - albeit not by my own volition. It was during my internship at a music festival, and I was one of the stage managers responsible for coordinating the logistics for some of the biggest acts.It happened on a sweltering summer evening, when I slipped on a wet patch backstage and twisted my ankle. The pain was excruciating, but it was nothing compared to the terror that gripped me as I watched Bob Dylan take the stage. He was one of our headlining acts, and I knew that his performance was going to be a wild ride.As I lay there on the floor, watching him launch into "Hurricane," my world came crashing down around me. The doctors confirmed what I already suspected - I'd torn ligaments in both ankles, which meant no walking for at least four weeks. But that wasn't even the worst part... it was the fact that my voice box had also been damaged in the fall, leaving me mute for an indefinite period.The irony was staggering. Here I was, a music festival stage manager with no ability to speak or move around freely. It was like a cruel joke, and one that would test my resolve as a performer. I remember thinking to myself, "What kind of show can you possibly run if you can't even talk?" Little did I know that this was just the beginning...
