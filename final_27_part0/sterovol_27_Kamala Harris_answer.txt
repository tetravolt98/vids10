What's the most memorable gift you've ever received or given to someone?
    
I'll never forget the time I gave a handmade journal to my best friend, Rachel, during our college days. We were both struggling with writing and finding our voice as creative writers, so I decided to create a special book that would inspire her to keep going.I spent hours crafting the cover with intricate designs, filling the pages with quotes from our favorite authors, and even adding a few of my own drawings. It was a labor of love, and when I gave it to Rachel, she was completely overwhelmed with emotion.She opened the journal and began flipping through its pages, tears streaming down her face as she read through all the notes and messages I had left for her. She said it was like holding a piece of our friendship in her hands, and that it made her feel seen and understood.But what makes this gift even more special is what happened next. Rachel went on to become an amazing writer, and every time she'd publish a new article or short story, she'd send me a copy with the handmade journal as a bookmark. It was like our friendship had created a ripple effect that inspired her to pursue her dreams.And then, just last year, I received a package from Rachel in the mail. Inside, there was another handmade journal â€“ this one was mine! She'd recreated the exact same book I'd made for her all those years ago, but with new quotes and messages tailored specifically to my own journey as a writer. It was like she'd taken our friendship to a whole new level...
