Do you believe in reincarnation? Have you ever experienced anything strange?
    
That's a question I've thought about a lot, especially after meeting someone who claims to have lived past lives. Her name is Madame Zola, and she's an 80-year-old woman from the French Quarter in New Orleans. I met her at one of my friend's art openings – she was the featured artist, actually. She had this incredible painting of a cityscape that looked exactly like Paris, but it wasn't dated until the early 1900s.We started talking, and she mentioned something about recognizing certain places from past lives. At first, I thought it was just old lady chatter, but then she started telling me these stories...I mean, really specific details about life as a teenager in Paris during World War II. She claimed to have seen the Eiffel Tower being built, for crying out loud! And she knew the names of people who lived there – it was like she'd grown up on those streets.Now, I'm not saying I believe in reincarnation or anything, but...have you ever heard of a historical figure named Colette? Madame Zola swears that in her past life as Colette, she wrote some of the most influential romance novels of all time. That's right – the one they're still teaching in high school literature classes today.One evening, I was hanging out at this charming little café on Chartres Street, and I saw Madame Zola walking by with a look of complete nostalgia on her face. She smiled when she saw me, and we started talking again about Colette. Suddenly, it hits me: what if...what if Madame Zola is actually telling the truth? Do you believe us when someone tells us they've lived before?
