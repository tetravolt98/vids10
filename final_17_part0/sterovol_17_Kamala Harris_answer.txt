What's the worst thing that's happened to you this week? Silver linings welcome!
    
This week has been a real doozy, and I'm not even kidding when I say it started with me spilling coffee all over my favorite white shirt on Monday morning. I mean, who needs caffeine anyway, right?But the real kicker was Wednesday night when I got to experience the thrill of having my car's catalytic converter stolen... in a parking lot that was being monitored by security cameras. Yes, you read that right - they took it while I was watching TV just a few feet away.Now, here's the silver lining: as I was trying to figure out how to get it replaced (and dealing with the lovely people at my insurance company), I stumbled upon an old friend from high school who happened to be working on his own car project in his garage. Long story short, we ended up having a fantastic impromptu dinner and catching up on each other's lives - it was like no time had passed at all.And that brings me to last night... which is actually still unfolding, to be honest. As I was driving home from said friend's place (with my new, slightly-used catalytic converter in tow), I received a call from an unknown number. I answered it, and on the other end was a mysterious voice claiming to have information about a project I'd been working on for months now. The thing is, I haven't told anyone about this project... or so I thought.So, that's my week in a nutshell - car troubles, unexpected reunions, and now, a mystery caller who's got me wondering if someone's been watching my every move. What do you think it could be?
