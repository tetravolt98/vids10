Would you rather have a million dollars or be able to travel anywhere for free?
    
You know who I'd give my right arm to meet? Jack Kerouac! I've had the craziest experience with him, and it's one that still sends shivers down my spine.It was 1960, and I was a young writer in New York City. Jack, being the iconic beat poet he was, had just arrived in town from Paris, and I'd heard whispers about his wild adventures on the road. I managed to track him down to this tiny caf√© in Greenwich Village, where I stumbled upon him typing away on his portable typewriter.He invited me to join him for a night of writing and whiskey-fueled conversations. We talked about everything from the absurdity of modern life to the beauty of spontaneity. His words dripped with a sense of freedom that was infectious. Before I knew it, we were planning an impromptu road trip out West.For three days, Jack and I traveled through the American Southwest, sleeping in our car and scribbling down poetry on whatever scraps of paper we could find. We talked about nothing and everything at once, drinking in the vast expanses of desert landscapes and the stars twinkling above us.Now, given that choice... do you think having a million dollars would allow me to relive those moments with Jack? Or maybe even convince him to join me on another adventure? I'd trade it all for just one more night of traveling with him, free from the burdens of money. What do you think? Would the freedom to roam and experience life's beauty be worth any price?
