Have you ever had to deal with a bully? How did you handle it?
    
Bullying. Yeah, I've dealt with my fair share of that. In fact, I still remember the kid who made my life miserable in middle school. His name was Jake, and he thought it was hilarious to push people around, just because he could.I tried to ignore him at first, but that only seemed to egg him on. He'd knock over my books, spill my lunch, or just plain old give me a nasty look. I'd try to stand up for myself, but whenever I did, Jake would somehow manage to make it seem like I was the one who was in the wrong.One day, though, something snapped inside me. I'd had enough of being pushed around, and I decided I wasn't going to take it anymore. So, during lunch, I stood up for myself in front of the whole school. I called Jake out on his behavior, right there in the cafeteria. It was a pretty big moment.But here's the thing: after that, things didn't exactly get better. If anything, they got worse. Jake started targeting me even more aggressively, and some of my classmates began to take his side. I started to feel like I was all alone...And then, just as things were getting really intense, something unexpected happened...
