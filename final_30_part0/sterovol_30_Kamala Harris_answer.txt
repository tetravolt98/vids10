What's the worst advice you've ever gotten from someone in authority?
    
I'm still cringing just thinking about it - my guidance counselor in high school telling me to "play it safe" when I wanted to pursue a career in music. I know, I know, it sounds crazy now, but at the time I was all about following rules and doing what everyone else expected of me.So, she advised me to take a more stable route - business or pre-med, maybe something with a "real future." And honestly, it's not like I didn't listen. For a while, I played along, thinking that maybe she knew better than I did about what was best for me.But then I started playing in local bands and recording demos on the side. It wasn't easy - my parents were worried sick, my friends thought I was being reckless... but something inside of me just wouldn't let go of this dream.And then, out of nowhere, a producer from a major label reached out to me about one of those demo tracks. Next thing I knew, I was on tour with a popular band and making more money in one month than my parents ever had all year.Looking back, it's like that guidance counselor saw the world through this super narrow lens - she just didn't get that there are some things you can't plan or prepare for, no matter how hard you try. And I'm not saying I'd recommend taking a risk on a music career to everyone, but... what if your gut is trying to tell you something? What if the safe route isn't actually the right one for you?
