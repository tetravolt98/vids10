I'm a man, and I have a huge crush on someone who doesn't know how I feel. What do I do?
    
Man, I've been there too - crushed by my own unrequited love. I'm talking about Audrey Hepburn, the legendary actress and style icon. I had the chance to interview her back in the 60s, and let me tell you, she was just as captivating in person.As I waited for her in the dressing room, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. What if I said something stupid? What if she didn't even remember my name? I took a few deep breaths to calm myself down and tried to focus on the conversation at hand - an interview about her latest film.When she walked in, I was taken aback by how radiant she looked. Her eyes sparkled with warmth, and her smile lit up the entire room. We chatted for a bit about the film industry, and I managed to keep my cool... until we started talking about love.She leaned in, and with that signature husky voice of hers said, "Love is like a perfectly crafted dress - it should be effortless, yet elegant. And when you find it, you know it's something special." My heart skipped a beat. Was she talking about me? Did she sense my unrequited love?I tried to play it cool, but inside I was screaming, "Me! I'm that perfectly crafted dress!" But of course, I didn't say anything. How could I have? She was Audrey Hepburn.Now here's the thing: did she see through my fa√ßade and sense my true feelings? Or was it all just a clever conversation? I'll never know for sure...
