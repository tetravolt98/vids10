I'm a man, and I have a huge love for gaming. Am I wasting my time?
    
The eternal debate. Let me tell you, I've had this argument with myself for years when it comes to my idol, John Romero - one of the most iconic game designers in history. I mean, the guy created Doom and Quake, for crying out loud! He's a legend.But what people don't know is that John was also an avid poker player, and I got to meet him at a gaming convention a few years ago. We were talking about our shared love of games, and he told me about how he would spend hours on end playing poker in the early days of his career.Now, you'd think that's just time wasted on cards, right? But John saw it differently. He said those hours at the poker table allowed him to clear his mind, relax, and recharge for the long coding sessions ahead. And that's when the magic happened - he created some of his most iconic games while in a state of flow.So, was he wasting his time on poker? Not from my perspective. John saw it as a way to refuel and come back to his craft with a fresh perspective. And let me tell you, it paid off. He's one of the greatest game designers of all time.But here's the thing - what about when I'm stuck in an endless loop of gaming sessions? Is that just a waste of time, or am I using it as a way to recharge for my own creative pursuits? I like to think it's the latter... but only time will tell. Do you think there's value in taking breaks to do things we love, even if they're not directly related to our work?
