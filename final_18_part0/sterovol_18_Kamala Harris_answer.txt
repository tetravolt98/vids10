Do you believe in love at first sight, or is it just lust?
    
I've had the privilege of knowing Leonardo DiCaprio for several years now, and I'll tell you a story that still makes my heart skip a beat. We were on set during the filming of "The Great Gatsby", and I was assigned to help with his wardrobe. Let's just say he was as charming in person as he is on screen.One day, while we were getting ready for a particularly grueling scene, he caught me staring at him (it was impossible not to!). He flashed that iconic smile and said, "Hey, you look lost." I blushed like crazy and muttered something about needing help finding my way around the set. Next thing I knew, he took my hand and led me through the crowded crew area, effortlessly navigating us past camera equipment and assistants.We ended up at the edge of a beautiful lake on the outskirts of the production location. He stopped walking and turned to face me, his eyes locked onto mine in this intense, piercing gaze that left me breathless. It was as if time had stopped, and all I could think about was how much I wanted to be in that moment with him.Was it love at first sight? Lust, you ask? Well... let's just say I knew right then and there that our conversation would change everything for me. The question is: did he feel the same way?
