Have you ever had to make an embarrassing phone call? How did you recover?
    
Oh man, I'm still cringing just thinking about it... It was during my college days, and I'd somehow managed to get myself on a list of people who got invited to a exclusive networking dinner with none other than Warren Buffett. I mean, the Oracle of Omaha himself! I was beyond excited to meet him, but what I didn't realize at first was that I had accidentally RSVP'd as "yes" instead of actually confirming my attendance through the proper channels. By the time I figured it out, it was too late - the event was just a day away.Panicked, I tried calling the organizers to explain the mix-up and beg for mercy, but they were impossible to reach. And so, on the night of the dinner, I ended up having to call Warren Buffett himself to apologize and inform him that I wouldn't be attending after all... in front of my entire class's debate team, no less!I mustered up every ounce of courage I had left (and a healthy dose of self-deprecation) and managed to laugh it off with him over the phone. To my surprise, he chuckled along with me and even offered some words of encouragement.But here's the thing: not only did I survive that humiliation, but also... I got an email from Warren Buffett himself the very next day, thanking me for my honesty and inviting me to a private lecture on value investing at his company!
