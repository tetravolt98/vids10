If you could turn back time and redo any decision in your past, what would it be?
    
You know, I've always been fascinated by the life of Frida Kahlo. And if I'm being completely honest, I've often found myself wondering what her story would have looked like if she had made just one different choice.For me, that choice is leaving Mexico to study art in France with Diego Rivera's support. It's no secret that their tumultuous relationship was marked by infidelity and heartbreak, but at the time, Frida saw this as an opportunity to hone her craft and gain international recognition.If I could turn back time, I'd tell a 22-year-old Frida to stay in Mexico. I think she would have found her artistic voice more quickly if she hadn't been swept up in Diego's whirlwind of politics, passion, and drama. She might have avoided the physical and emotional pain that came with their relationship, too.But here's the thing: Frida was a woman ahead of her time. And I often wonder what would have happened if she had taken a more traditional path – getting married to someone stable, raising a family, and living a relatively quiet life. Would her art have suffered for it? Or would she have found new ways to channel her creativity and resilience?I've spent countless hours poring over Frida's letters and diaries, imagining what it must have been like to live in her skin. And I still find myself asking: what if? What if she had made a different choice that day, back in 1922? Would everything have turned out differently for her – and for me?
