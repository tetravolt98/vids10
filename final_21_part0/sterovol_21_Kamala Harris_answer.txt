What's the most spontaneous thing you've ever done? Would you do it again?
    
Man, I'd have to say it was buying a one-way ticket to Tokyo without a plan. I'd always been fascinated by Japanese culture, but never had the guts to just pick up and go. So, on a whim, I decided that if I didn't book the ticket right then, something (or someone) would talk me out of it.I remember standing at the counter, swiping my card, and watching the confirmation code print out on the screen. It was like a rush of adrenaline had taken over – my heart was racing, my palms were sweating... I knew I'd crossed some kind of threshold. The lady behind the counter just raised an eyebrow and asked if I wanted to upgrade to business class. I laughed and said no way, I'm good.Fast forward 36 hours, and I'm on a train heading to Shinjuku with nothing but a backpack full of clothes and a Lonely Planet guidebook. It was exhilarating and terrifying all at once – the thought of navigating unfamiliar streets, trying new foods... the list goes on. But in that moment, I felt completely alive.Would I do it again? Absolutely. The experience taught me so much about resilience, adaptability, and trusting my instincts. And yet... as I sit here thinking about it now, a part of me wonders what would've happened if I'd never taken that leap. Would I still be living in Tokyo today? Or would I have ended up somewhere entirely different?There's still a part of me that wants to find out.
