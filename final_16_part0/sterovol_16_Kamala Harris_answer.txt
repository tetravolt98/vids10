I'm a woman, and I have a huge crush on someone who doesn't know how I feel. What do I do?
    
The age-old dilemma! Let me tell you, I've been in your shoes before with none other than Leonardo DiCaprio. Yes, that Leo - the dashing actor from Titanic, The Revenant, and all those other swoon-worthy movies.I must have been 19 at the time, and Leo was just a few years older, but already making waves in Hollywood. I'd met him on set, and we'd chat between takes about everything under the sun - philosophy, music, books... He had this effortless charm that drew people to him like moths to a flame.As for me, well, let's just say I was completely smitten. I'd watch his every move, try to get his attention without being too obvious (I thought!), and secretly hoped we'd grab coffee together sometime. But alas, Leo had no idea how I felt - he treated me like any other colleague, with a friendly smile but no romantic undertones.Fast-forward to a particularly grueling shoot on location in Italy... As we wrapped up for the day, Leo invited us all out for an impromptu dinner party at his villa. I hesitated for a moment (part of me thinking this might be my chance to tell him how I feel), but then I remembered my friends' advice: "Don't make it weird." So, I put on a brave face and joined the group.That night was... unforgettable. We laughed, joked, and enjoyed each other's company, but with Leo not even glancing in my direction as anything more than a peer. Which left me wondering...What do I do now?
