Do you believe in love at first sight, or is it just lust?
    
The eternal debate. I've had the pleasure of knowing Leonardo DiCaprio for a number of years, and I can tell you that his take on love at first sight was always a bit more complicated than just lust. We'd spend hours talking about his various relationships over the years - Gisele, Bar Refaeli, Blake Lively... and he'd often say that with each new person, he thought maybe this time it would be different.But then I met him at a charity event in Los Angeles a few years ago, and something shifted. He was surrounded by a crowd of admirers, but his eyes kept scanning the room until they landed on someone - a woman with piercing green eyes and hair as black as night. They locked gazes for what felt like an eternity, and I swear you could see the sparks flying back and forth.He later told me that it was love at first sight, pure and simple. But I'm not so sure... He's always been someone who wears his heart on his sleeve, but even he couldn't deny the chemistry between them. And yet... as we left the event together, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to this connection than just a fleeting romance.Now, here's where it gets interesting: several months later, I ran into him at a restaurant and asked how things were going with Green Eyes (as he'd come to call her). His response? "It's complicated," he said with a smile. Complicated, indeed... Want to know what happened next?
