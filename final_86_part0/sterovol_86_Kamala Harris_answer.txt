Have you ever had to make an embarrassing phone call? How did you recover?
    
Yes! I'm still a little embarrassed thinking about it... So, it was during my early twenties, and I'd just landed an internship at a big music festival in California. I was beyond excited – it was going to be my first real gig, and I couldn't wait to meet the artists, learn from the pros, and maybe even snag some industry connections.Fast forward to the day of the event, and I realized that our team's head of marketing had left her phone charger at the office... back in New York. And guess who was supposed to be on stage in a few hours? The infamous rockstar, Liam Nightingale – think David Bowie meets Kurt Cobain.I'm talking to one of my colleagues, frantically trying to figure out what to do, when I remember that Liam's team had handed me his personal phone number before he took the stage (long story). So, I take a deep breath, grab the phone, and dial... and of course, it goes straight to voicemail. I'm starting to sweat, thinking about how this is going to look on social media – "Marketing team fails epicly"...I leave him a sheepish message, hoping against hope that he'll pick up. And then, out of nowhere, my phone starts ringing... It's Liam himself! He answers, chuckles at me (in the best possible way), and tells me not to worry about it – "These things happen!" We have a quick chat, and I assure him we're on top of it. Crisis averted!But here's the thing: that phone call changed my perspective. It taught me that even when you mess up, being honest and owning up to your mistakes can sometimes be more than enough...
