What's the most unlikely thing that's happened to you recently? Good or bad?
    
It was just a few days ago, actually. I've always been fascinated by Frida Kahlo's life and art, so I decided to take a road trip to her old home in La Casa Azul in Mexico City. I'd heard it was like stepping into a painting – the colors, the smells, everything.As I walked through the blue-tiled courtyard, I felt like I was walking in her footsteps. The air was thick with the scent of jasmine and old books. I spent hours exploring every nook and cranny, taking photos, and imagining what it must have been like for Frida to live here during the tumultuous 1920s.But then something unexpected happened. I stumbled upon a small, secret room that I had somehow missed on my first tour of the house. It was hidden behind a bookshelf, and the sign said 'The Studio.' I pushed open the door, and inside, I found an old easel, paints, and canvases – it was like she'd just stepped away for a minute.I couldn't believe my eyes. Was this where Frida actually painted some of her most famous works? I looked around in awe, taking photos to prove that I wasn't dreaming. Suddenly, I heard footsteps coming from outside the room...
