Would you rather lose your phone or laptop for a week? How would you survive?
    
Hands down, I'd rather lose my laptop for a week. I know, I know, in today's world, our phones are basically an extension of ourselves, but for me, it's the laptop that keeps me sane.I've had my current laptop since college, and let me tell you, it's been through thick and thin with me. It's seen me cry over a 3am essay deadline, binge-watch an entire season of my favorite show on Netflix (don't judge), and even survived a few too many coffee spills.But losing my phone? That'd be like losing a part of myself. I'm one of those people who has their phone attached to their hip at all times. I mean, what if someone calls or texts me with an emergency? What if I need to look something up for work?Losing my laptop would actually give me a sense of freedom. I'd have to rely on the old-fashioned ways â€“ using public computers, borrowing from friends, and even (gasp!) doing some actual thinking before typing away.The first few days without my laptop would be tough, but eventually, I think I'd find ways to adapt. I might even rediscover some of my favorite books or hobbies that don't require a screen. But then...then something unexpected happened during those first few days: I started receiving mysterious messages on my phone from an unknown number. They were cryptic and intriguing, with just one phrase each day: "Meet me at the old oak tree at midnight." Who could it be? And what did they want to meet about?
