I'm a man, and I have a huge love for gaming. Am I wasting my time?
    
The age-old debate about gaming's worth. Let me tell you, I've had some of the most epic experiences of my life through gaming - but also, some of the most frustrating ones.I think back to the countless hours I spent playing World of Warcraft with my friends in college. We'd spend hours exploring Azeroth, raiding dungeons, and perfecting our PvP skills. Those were some of the best times of my life - we were all about that gaming life together. But then, there were the times when I'd get so obsessed with beating a particular boss or leveling up my character that I'd neglect everything else... including sleep.Fast forward to today, and I'm still an avid gamer, but my priorities have shifted. I've got a job, friends, and relationships outside of gaming - which is exactly what I needed. Gaming has become more of a hobby for me now, something I enjoy in moderation. I can get lost in a great game, no doubt about it... but I'm also more aware of the time I spend playing.The question is, though: am I still wasting my time? Or have I found that sweet spot where gaming complements my life instead of controlling it?
