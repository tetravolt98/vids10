What's the worst thing that's happened to you this week? Silver linings welcome!
    
Where do I even start? Okay, so it was Monday morning and I woke up late for a breakfast meeting with none other than the one and only Julia Child. Yes, you read that right – Julia Child herself!I had been trying to track her down for months, hoping to interview her for my cooking blog. And finally, after countless emails and phone calls, she agreed to meet me at this quaint little café in Paris. I was so excited to show off my language skills (or lack thereof) and discuss everything from French cuisine to the art of cooking.But as I rushed out the door, I realized I'd left my notes on the kitchen counter – including all the questions I had prepared for her! Panic set in, but I quickly grabbed a notepad and scribbled down some last-minute questions. I mean, how could I possibly ask the legendary Julia Child about French cuisine without some basic research under my belt?We arrived at the café, and Julia greeted me with that signature warmth of hers. As we sipped our coffee and croissants, she asked me what I wanted to talk about – and I sheepishly confessed my prep-less state. To my surprise, she burst out laughing and said, "Ah, bien sûr! Let's start from scratch, shall we?" And just like that, we spent the next two hours chatting about food, life, and everything in between.So, was it a bad thing that happened this week? Not at all – I got to meet Julia Child, learn from her, and even pick up some quick French phrases. But here's the thing: what do you think she meant by "starting from scratch"? Was she referring to my lack of preparation or something more...?
