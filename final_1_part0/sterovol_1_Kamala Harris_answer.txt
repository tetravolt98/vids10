I'm a 30-year-old man, and I still live with my parents. Am I weird?
    
The judgmental looks from friends and family aside, I'd say living at home past your twenties can be... complicated. At least, it was for me. I lived with my parents until I was 32, and people often thought I was the epitome of laziness or had simply given up on life.But the truth is, my circumstances were a bit more... nuanced. After losing my job in my late twenties, I found myself struggling to get back on my feet financially. The cost of living where I was seemed to skyrocket overnight, and even taking on multiple part-time gigs couldn't cover all my expenses. My parents, who'd been helping me out since the layoff, asked if I could stay with them for a bit longer until I got my life sorted.Fast-forward two years, and here I am â€“ still living at home, but not because I'm lazy or avoidant of responsibility. I've been working hard to turn things around, taking online courses to boost my skills, networking like crazy, and slowly rebuilding my career. My parents have been incredibly supportive throughout this process.So, am I weird? Maybe a bit. But I'd argue that it's not about the living arrangement itself; it's about what you're doing with your time while you're there. Are you using the extra resources to better yourself, or are you simply relying on them as an excuse for not taking action?Now, where do I draw the line between still being at home and finally making the leap into full-on adulthood? That's the real question...
