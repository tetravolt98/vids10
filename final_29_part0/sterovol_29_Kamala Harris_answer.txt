Have you ever had a disagreement with your best friend? How did you resolve it?
    
Oh boy, have I! In fact, I still remember like it was yesterday when my best friend Emily and I got into a heated argument over something ridiculous. We were in college at the time, and we'd been inseparable since freshman year. One evening, after a particularly grueling exam week, we went out to grab some dinner and celebrate making it through the semester alive.As we were walking back to our dorms, Emily started teasing me about my haircut, which I'd just gotten from one of those fancy-schmancy salons on campus. She was joking around, but I'm a bit of a sensitive soul, and I took offense. Next thing I knew, we were standing in the middle of the quad, shouting at each other. It was... quite the scene.The argument escalated quickly, with both of us getting defensive and hurt. We didn't speak to each other for days, which was a first for us. But eventually, we realized that our friendship meant more than some silly haircut controversy. So, we met up in the dorm lounge (with a fresh batch of ice cream from the vending machine, no less), and slowly started talking it out.It turned out that I'd been feeling really stressed about school at the time, and Emily's jokes had inadvertently touched on something raw for me. And as we talked through it, we both realized how easily things could have gotten blown way out of proportion. We apologized to each other, laughed about it (the haircut, not the fight itself), and were back to our normal, teasing selves within hours.But here's what still fascinates me: even after we resolved that disagreement, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more going on beneath the surface...
