Have you ever lied about something small, only to have it blow up in your face?
    
I'm reminded of a summer I spent working at my family's beachside resort when I was a teenager. My best friend and coworker, Alex, was notorious for his love of pranks on our guests. One day, he convinced me that if we told the manager, Mr. Jenkins, that we had "lost" a valuable diamond necklace left by one of the high-rollers, he would be so impressed with our honesty that he'd give us each a week's pay as a reward.So, Alex and I reluctantly confessed to Mr. Jenkins about the missing necklace, trying to play it cool while secretly holding back giggles. To our surprise, Mr. Jenkins not only rewarded us with two weeks' pay but also praised us for being honest and taking responsibility for our actions. We were thrilled and felt like we'd really pulled off a masterstroke.Fast-forward 24 hours: the real owner of the diamond necklace comes storming into the office, furious that her priceless family heirloom is missing. Mr. Jenkins looks at Alex and me with a "you're in trouble" expression... and then proceeds to reveal that the whole ordeal was actually just an elaborate scheme cooked up by him! It turned out he had staged the entire thing as a test of our character â€“ and we'd passed!I'm still laughing about it today, but what really gets my imagination racing is: do you think Mr. Jenkins' prank would have been just as effective if we hadn't actually believed ourselves to be in trouble?
