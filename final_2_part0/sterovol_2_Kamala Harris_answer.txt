If you could go back in time and give advice to your teenage self, what would it be?
    
Where do I even start? If I'm being completely honest, my teenage self was a hot mess. I was always trying to fit in with the "cool kids" crowd, while secretly struggling to find my own identity. Looking back, I wish someone had told me that it's okay to be different.I remember being obsessed with The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix - their music was like my soundtrack for angst and rebellion. But what I didn't realize at the time was how much pressure I put on myself to conform to certain standards of style or popularity. If I could go back, I'd tell myself to chill out and be more me.I'd advise my teenage self to take risks and pursue passions that seemed crazy at the time, like learning guitar (which didn't quite work out, but hey, it was fun trying!). And don't get me wrong, having a tight-knit group of friends is amazing - but not at the expense of losing myself in the process.Here's the thing: I've always been drawn to creative types, and now as an adult, I see how those experiences shaped my love for music, art, and writing. But what if I had pushed myself even harder back then? Would I have discovered a hidden talent or two?As I'm thinking about this, I realize that there's still so much I don't know about myself - or where life is taking me next. So, to my teenage self, I'd say: be bold, take chances, and above all, stay curious...
