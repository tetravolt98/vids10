I'm a woman, and I hate my job. Should I quit or just suck it up?
    
Girl, I totally get it. I used to work in a job that was sucking the life out of me, too - corporate PR for a huge company. The politics, the backstabbing, the constant stress... I thought I'd never escape.But then I had an epiphany (or what felt like one at the time). I realized that I wasn't just miserable in my job, I was also stuck in a life that didn't feel true to me. My passion for photography and storytelling had always been put on the backburner while I worked towards some arbitrary corporate goal.One day, I finally admitted to myself that I was unhappy, and it was time to take control of my life. But here's the thing: quitting wasn't as easy as just walking out the door (which, trust me, is a tempting thought). I had bills to pay, responsibilities to consider... and let's be real, the fear of the unknown.So, what did I do? Well, that's where things get interesting. I started taking small steps towards my true passion - photography. I began freelancing on the side, capturing weddings and portraits for friends and family. It was scary at first (who pays me to take pictures?!), but it also felt... alive.Now, fast-forward a few months, and here's where we get to the good stuff: that same job I hated so much? Yeah, they offered me a promotion last week. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Should I have just sucked it up and stayed in my comfort zone? Do I take this new role and try to change from within... or do I finally take the leap and pursue the life I've always dreamed of?
