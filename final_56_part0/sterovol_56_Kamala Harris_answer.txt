Have you ever had a secret crush on someone for years? What finally happened?
    
The infamous Charlie Chaplin. I met him when I was just a teenager working at a small café in London during the early days of cinema. He'd often stroll in, his fedora clutched under one arm, and order a cup of strong black coffee to go with his scribbled-up scripts.I won't lie; I had a secret crush on him for years – even after he became this international sensation, known as the "Little Tramp." There was something about the way he'd laugh with that deep rumble of his, or how his eyes would sparkle when he talked about his craft. But, at the time, it seemed like an impossible dream to get close to him.One day, I was tasked with running errands for Chaplin while he worked on a new film in the studio next door. I'd sneak glances of him through the windows as I hurried by, my heart racing. And then, out of nowhere, he approached me one afternoon, looking frazzled and disheveled.He asked if I could help him gather some props from his trunk – an old top hat, a worn cane, and a couple of antique pocket watches. As we worked together, our fingers touching as we handed each item back and forth... well, it was like the whole world had paused. We exchanged a few furtive glances, but nothing more.And that's when he whispered to me, "Meet me at the back door after dark. I have an idea for something special." And with that, my secret crush got a whole lot more interesting...
