I'm a woman, and I have a huge fear of failure. Any advice?
    
Failure - it's a word that used to send shivers down my spine, especially when I was trying to pursue my dreams as a young artist in Paris. I had always been fascinated by the life and work of Frida Kahlo, and her fearlessness in the face of adversity was something I aspired to.One day, while exploring the streets of Montmartre, I stumbled upon a small museum dedicated to her life and art. As I wandered through the rooms, taking in the vibrant colors and poignant expressions on her canvas, I came across a quote that has stuck with me ever since: "Feet, what do I need you for when I have imagination?"For me, that was a wake-up call. I realized that my fear of failure wasn't about not succeeding at all, but about not being good enough, or talented enough. And it was then that I made a conscious decision to shift my mindset.I started to focus on the process, not just the end result. I began to enjoy the journey of creating art, experimenting with colors and techniques, and letting go of the need for perfection. And you know what? It's been liberating!But here's the thing: it's still a work in progress. Some days, I'm more confident than others. Some days, I feel like giving up altogether. But every time I sit down to paint or write, I remind myself of Frida's words.And that's where you come in - do you have a fear of failure? Because if so, let's face it together...
