If you could turn back time and redo any decision in your past, what would it be?
    
You know, I've always been fascinated by the life of Frida Kahlo. I mean, who wouldn't want to delve into her creative world and experience the passion that radiated from every brushstroke? I had the privilege of attending a retrospective exhibit on her work at the Museum of Modern Art in New York when I was a student.As I wandered through the galleries, I found myself drawn to one painting in particular - "The Two Fridas". There's something about the duality of her depiction that resonated with me. One side is dressed in a Victorian-era wedding dress, while the other wears a simpler, more Bohemian outfit. It was as if she was showing us two sides of herself, and I couldn't help but wonder which one was truly Frida.I remember being struck by the story behind that painting - how it was inspired by her own experiences with identity and cultural heritage. It made me think about my own decisions in life, particularly the ones related to my creative pursuits. If I'm being honest, there's one decision that still haunts me...If I could turn back time, I'd go back to when I decided not to pursue art full-time after graduating from college. I remember feeling pressure from family and friends to take a more "stable" career path, so I ended up going into graphic design instead. Looking back, I think I sold myself short. The fire that once burned within me to create something truly meaningful had begun to flicker...
