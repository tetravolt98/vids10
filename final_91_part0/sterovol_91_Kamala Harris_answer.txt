Have you ever had a secret crush on someone who doesn't know how you feel? What finally happened?
    
The secret crush that still makes my heart skip a beat is on none other than the one and only David Bowie. It was during his 1974 "Diamond Dogs" tour, when I snuck backstage to meet him at the iconic Madison Square Garden in New York City.I had been following his music for years, mesmerized by his chameleon-like persona and innovative style. As a teenager, I was smitten with his charismatic stage presence, poetic lyrics, and bold fashion sense. My friends would often tease me about my "obvious" infatuation, but I couldn't deny the way his music made me feel.That night, as I watched him perform "Rebel Rebel," I mustered up the courage to meet him backstage. My friend managed to get us an introduction, and I was taken aback by how kind and genuine he was in person. We talked about everything from art to politics, and I found myself feeling more at ease than I thought possible.Just as we were wrapping up our conversation, Bowie mentioned that he was working on a new project â€“ a musical film called "The Man Who Fell to Earth." He asked for my opinion on the script, which left me completely starstruck. Little did I know that this chance encounter would mark the beginning of an unlikely friendship...
