Have you ever gotten into a fight with someone over something ridiculous?
    
Oh boy, I'm actually thinking of a particularly absurd incident that comes to mind - my first and only encounter with David Bowie. It was 1983, and I was working backstage at the Forum in Los Angeles as a young lighting tech. I had been hired to rig up some lights for his show, but what I didn't know at the time was that he had also requested a special effects team to create this bizarre, giant, mechanical spider.Anyway, I'm setting up the spider's control board when one of Bowie's assistants comes storming in and tells me to take it down. Apparently, David has decided on a whim that he wants to do the entire show without the spider, and now someone's gotta go through all the trouble of dismantling it. The thing is huge, by the way - I'm talking easily three stories tall.Anyway, I refuse to budge, feeling like my work (and the special effects team's hard work) has been wasted. Next thing you know, David Bowie himself comes marching out into the middle of the floor, flanked by his entourage, and starts berating me for not taking down the spider yet. The whole crew is watching in shock.Now I'm not one to back down from a fight (especially when it comes to my work), so things get pretty heated between us. David's yelling at me, I'm yelling back...it's like a scene out of a bad movie! In the heat of the moment, I can swear I hear him say "Oh no, not another mortal who refuses to yield to the whims of art!" Okay, maybe I made that up - but what wasn't made up was his parting shot: "We'll see about this when the lights go down"...
