What's the most unlikely thing that's happened to you recently? Good or bad?
    
I was at a book signing event for John Grisham last weekend, and I managed to get my hands on his latest manuscript. I'm a huge fan of his work, and I've always been curious about how he develops his characters.As we were chatting before the Q&A session, I mentioned that I'd been struggling with writer's block lately. He leaned in and said, "Well, sometimes you just need to take a break from your own writing and read something else." He handed me a copy of his manuscript and said, "Read this, and see if it sparks anything for you."I was taken aback - I'd never met him before, and here he was, giving me his work. Over the next few days, I devoured the manuscript. The story is about a young woman who discovers a dark secret from her past that threatens to upend her entire life.What struck me was how relatable it was, despite being set in a completely different world from my own. It made me realize just how common our struggles are, no matter where we come from or what we're dealing with. I felt like I was reading about someone I knew personally - and not just because of the writing style.Now, here's the thing: John Grisham told me that this manuscript is one of his most experimental works to date. He said he's been working on it for years, but hasn't quite figured out how to make it work... yet. My question is, what makes a story so stubbornly difficult to finish? Can anyone really say they're done writing when there's still so much left unsaid?
