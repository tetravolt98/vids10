If you could turn back time and redo any decision in your past, what would it be?
    
That's a tough one. If I'm being completely honest, I'd go back to when I was a young journalist trying to land my first big scoop on Bob Marley. I was a huge fan of his music, and the idea of interviewing him for Rolling Stone was like the ultimate dream come true.I remember it was 1980, and Bob had just finished a string of sold-out shows in London. My editor at Rolling Stone sent me to track him down and get an exclusive interview. I spent hours scouring the streets of Notting Hill, following every lead I could find, until finally, I managed to corner him at this tiny little caf√© on Ladbroke Grove.I was so excited to ask him about his music, his message, all that jazz. But then...then he asked me if I wanted a spliff. And I said no. I know, I know - it's a huge regret now. Because the thing is, after that moment, things started getting weird. He became distant and evasive, like he was hiding something from me.To this day, I wonder what would have happened if I had just accepted that spliff and taken a chance with him. Would I have gotten that scoop? Would it have changed my career trajectory? The possibilities still haunt me.But here's the thing: even though I didn't get the interview, I did end up writing an amazing piece on Bob's impact on reggae music - just not the one I had hoped for. So maybe this decision, as tough as it was to make at the time, ultimately led me down a different path.But would I do it again? That's still up in the air...
