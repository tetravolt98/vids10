Have you ever 'accidentally' offended someone, only to realize you meant to do it?
    
The infamous time I "accidentally" insulted Albert Einstein. It's a story that still makes me chuckle and cringe at the same time.I was 25 and had just landed an internship at Princeton University's Institute for Advanced Study. I was a huge fan of the great physicist, having devoured every biography and paper on his work. One day, while setting up for a lecture he was scheduled to give, I overheard him complaining about the campus coffee.I couldn't resist chiming in with my own opinion. "Sir, if you think the coffee here is bad, you should try the stuff they serve at Harvard!" I said with a grin.Einstein's eyes narrowed as he turned to me. For a moment, I thought I'd made a grave mistake. But then, a slow smile spread across his face. "Ah, my young friend," he said in his thick German accent, "I think you meant to say that the coffee at Harvard is superior, didn't you?"My heart sank as I realized I might have inadvertently dissed Einstein's alma mater. But instead of being offended, he burst out laughing and patted me on the back. "Don't worry, mein freund," he said with a wink. "I'm sure it was just an... ahem... 'theoretical' remark."And with that, we both had a good laugh about it. I learned a valuable lesson that day: sometimes, people are more perceptive than you think! But here's the thing â€“ did Einstein really believe his coffee at Princeton was superior? Or was he just humoring me? To this day, I still wonder...
