Would you rather lose your voice for a week or be unable to use your legs for a month?
    
I've always been fascinated by the life of Frida Kahlo, and I have to say, I think she would give this exact same question a lot of thought. In fact, I like to imagine that I was friends with her back in the 1940s, and we'd often sit together at her home in Coyoac√°n, sipping tea and discussing the intricacies of art and life.If I had to choose, I think I would say... neither! But if I really had to pick, I'd say lose my voice for a week. Can you imagine how frustrating it must have been for Frida to be unable to express herself, to be silenced by her physical limitations? She was always so passionate about art and politics, and the inability to speak would have driven me crazy!But, as we sat together that day, she told me about a time when she was bedridden after one of her many accidents. Her voice, though barely above a whisper, still managed to convey the depth of her emotions. She spoke to me with such intensity, such conviction, and I felt like I was being transported into her world.And yet... as we talked, I couldn't help but notice that Frida seemed to be struggling to find the right words, to put into language the feelings that were bubbling up inside her. It was almost as if she was searching for a way to express something deeper, something that lay beyond the reach of words.I wonder... what would have happened if I had just kept listening, really kept listening?
