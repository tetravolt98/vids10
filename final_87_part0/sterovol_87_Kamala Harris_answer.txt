What's the most unlikely thing that's happened to you recently? Good or bad?
    
I'm still grinning as I think back to it. So, I was at a museum exhibit on impressionist art when out of nowhere, I run into none other than David Hockney himself! I mean, this is the guy who painted some of the most iconic works of the 20th century – the pool scenes, the landscapes... you know.I'm standing there, admiring his "A Bigger Splash" piece, when suddenly I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turn around and it's Hockney himself, looking every bit as dapper as one would expect an artist of his stature to be at 82 years young. We strike up a conversation about the exhibit – he had just been there for a private viewing, and I got to share some of my own impressions (no pun intended!).What made it even more surreal was that we ended up having this deep discussion about art, nature, and humanity... in front of a painting of a rather tranquil Los Angeles pool. It felt like I'd stumbled into one of his paintings come to life! He shared stories about his time with the Royal College of Art, about the influences behind some of his work... it was all just so fascinating.And here's the kicker: we exchanged numbers, and he asked if I'd be up for joining him on a painting trip out to California sometime soon. I mean, can you imagine?!
