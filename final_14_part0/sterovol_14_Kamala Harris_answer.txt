If you could turn back time and redo any decision, what would it be?
    
I've always been fascinated by the life of Frida Kahlo, but one decision that still haunts me to this day is when I had the chance to meet her in person. It was 1951, and she was living in Mexico City with her husband Diego Rivera.I had just arrived from Paris, where I'd spent months studying art and photography. My camera equipment and portfolio were overflowing with sketches of Mexican folk art, inspired by Frida's own work. I knew I couldn't miss this opportunity to meet the legendary artist.Diego answered my knock at their Blue House studio. He seemed distracted, preoccupied with his latest mural project, but still warm and welcoming. I explained that I was a huge fan, had come from afar just to see her art up close... and I'd brought some of my own sketches as gifts. His expression softened slightly, but he politely declined the offer of an audience.I hesitated, unsure whether to push the issue or leave quietly. Before I could decide, Frida herself appeared at the door, frail and smiling, using her crutch for support. She listened with interest as Diego translated our conversation. Her eyes sparkled as she took in my portfolio, nodding graciously before turning away.That brief encounter remains etched in my memory like a brushstroke on canvas â€“ vibrant yet fleeting. If I had to turn back time and redo that decision... would I have the courage to ask again? Or perhaps I'd discover something new by giving her space to create, lost in the whirlwind of her own world?Wouldn't you want to know what she might've said if I'd pushed just a little harder for that elusive chance meeting?
