Have you ever had to apologize to someone after doing something wrong? What did you say?
    
The infamous incident with Frida Kahlo. I'm not proud of it, but I'll own up to it. It was a few years ago when I visited the Blue House in Coyoacán, Mexico – her childhood home and studio. As an art historian, I had been studying her life and work for months.While admiring one of her self-portraits, I accidentally knocked over a glass of water on one of her precious sketchbooks. The pages were now soggy and discolored. Her staff was frantic, but I didn't realize the gravity of the situation.Not until Frida herself appeared in the room, looking every bit as fierce as she did in those famous photographs. She stared at me with a piercing gaze, her eyes seeming to bore into my soul. I was mortified.I stuttered out an apology, feeling like a complete idiot. "Señora Kahlo, I'm so sorry... I didn't mean to... it was just an accident..." I trailed off, expecting the worst.But instead of anger or disdain, she smiled – a small, enigmatic smile that seemed to suggest she knew more about me than I knew myself. She said, "Accidents happen, amigo. But what's important is how you respond to them."And then, just as I was starting to breathe again, she dropped another bombshell: "Would you be willing to learn from your mistake and make it right?" My mind went blank...
