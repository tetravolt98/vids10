What's the best thing that's ever happened to you by chance?
    
The best thing that's ever happened to me by chance... That would have to be the time I stumbled upon a secret concert given by none other than Bob Dylan in 1966. I was just a wide-eyed college student at the time, and I had heard rumors of him playing an impromptu show at this tiny club on the outskirts of town.I'd been driving home from a friend's house late one night when I saw a sea of people gathered outside this unassuming building. My curiosity got the best of me, and I pulled over to see what all the commotion was about. As I pushed my way through the crowd, someone handed me a flyer that read "Bob Dylan - 10 pm" in barely legible handwriting.I remember feeling like I'd stumbled into something special, but also totally unsure if it was real or just some prank. We snuck around to the side of the building and managed to slip inside just as Dylan took the stage. It was surreal – the man himself was playing guitar and singing with this hauntingly beautiful voice that sent shivers down my spine.But what's even crazier is that he started playing songs we'd never heard before, stuff that didn't make it onto his official albums. I remember thinking to myself, "What am I doing here? This is like witnessing history in the making!" And then, just as the night was winding down, Dylan starts talking about something called "Highway 61 Revisited" – a phrase that would later become synonymous with one of his most iconic songs...
