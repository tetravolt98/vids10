What's the worst haircut you've ever gotten, and did you recover from it?
    
The infamous "Mullet-gate" of my early twenties. I'm still cringing just thinking about it. I'd always been a bit of a rebel, so when I walked into that trendy salon with my friends to get our summer cuts, I told the stylist I wanted something edgy. Big mistake.She convinced me to go for what she called a "futuristic" style – think asymmetrical bob with a razor-sharp layer across the top of my head that was supposed to resemble a, um, interesting geometric shape. Yeah, it looked like a failed science experiment on my scalp.The first time I saw myself in the mirror, I thought I'd stumbled into some kind of bizarre alternate reality. My friends were trying not to giggle, but their faces said it all – they were mortified for me. My poor mom was even more shocked; she took one look and burst out laughing, saying "Oh dear, someone's been playing with the lawnmower again!"Needless to say, I spent the next few weeks hiding under baseball caps and avoiding mirrors altogether. But as I sat at my kitchen table, staring at myself in a particularly harsh overhead light (bad idea), something strange happened – I started to see it, not just as a haircut gone wrong, but as an opportunity to own it.I practiced striking poses in front of the mirror, embracing the weirdness and having a blast making fun of myself with my friends. We even started calling it "my avant-garde masterpiece." And you know what? It kinda grew on me (pun intended). I still have the Polaroids from that summer to remind me: never underestimate the power of good humor in recovery...
