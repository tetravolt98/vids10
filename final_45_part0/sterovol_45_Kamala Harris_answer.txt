Would you rather lose your phone or laptop for a week? How would you survive?
    
That's an easy one - I'd much rather lose my phone! Okay, so let me think... Last year, I was backpacking through Europe and lost my phone on the last night of a three-day hike in the Swiss Alps. I remember the panic that set in as I realized it was gone, along with all our group's plans for the next day.First things first, we had to figure out where we were going without being able to check Google Maps or use our phones' GPS. We ended up asking a local shopkeeper, who drew us a crude map on a piece of paper and pointed us in the direction of the nearest town. It was actually kind of liberating - we had to rely on each other and our own navigation skills.We also had to get creative with communication. My friend pulled out an old-school notebook and began writing down key points, like what time we needed to catch a bus the next day and where we were meeting for dinner. It was almost quaint, actually. We felt like we were in some kind of 19th-century novel.The biggest challenge, though, was getting work done while not having access to my laptop. I'm a writer, so I had to rely on scribbling down ideas by hand and storing them in my backpack for later. It was... interesting, to say the least. My handwriting's not exactly the neatest, but it got the job done.All in all, losing my phone was a nightmare, but I think I'd be able to survive without one for a week. But how about this - what would you do if you lost your phone and had to navigate a city like Tokyo or New York? Would you try to find a payphone (yes, they still exist in some places!) or just wing it and hope for the best?
