If you could go back in time and give advice to your teenage self, what would it be?
    
The teenager I was at 16 years old... so full of angst and uncertainty. If I'm being completely honest, that person was a mess. But looking back on those chaotic days with the benefit of hindsight, I'd love to go back in time and give my younger self some advice.First of all, I would tell myself to relax about it all. The drama, the relationships, the grades – none of it is as important as you think it is right now. Trust me, those things will pass. But what won't pass is your inner strength and resilience. So take care of yourself, physically and mentally.I'd also tell my teenage self to be kinder to others. I was always worried about how people perceived me, and that led me down some pretty toxic paths. Be the one who's genuinely interested in getting to know others – it'll make all the difference.And finally, I'd remind myself to enjoy the ride. These years are fleeting, and before you know it, you'll be graduating from high school (or whatever your equivalent is) and staring down the barrel of adulthood. Make the most of these experiences, even when they're hard – because they will shape who you become.But here's the thing: if I could go back in time and give myself this advice... would it really change anything? Would I still make the same mistakes, or would I somehow manage to avoid them altogether?
