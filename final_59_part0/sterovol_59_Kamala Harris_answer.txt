If you could turn back time and redo any decision in your past, what would it be?
    
I've thought about this a lot, to be honest. If I'm being completely truthful, there's one decision that still haunts me to this day - not pursuing music as a career. I was always passionate about singing and playing the guitar, but growing up in a family that valued stability and security above all else, my parents encouraged me to focus on more "practical" pursuits.I ended up studying business in college, thinking it would set me up for a secure future. But the truth is, every time I'm near a stage or a recording studio, I feel like I'm meant to be there. I think about all the amazing artists who have made careers out of their passions, and I wonder what could've been if I'd taken the leap.I remember walking out of the auditorium on graduation day, diploma in hand, feeling empty and unfulfilled. My parents were beaming with pride, but inside, I was screaming, "What am I doing? This isn't me!" It's a feeling that still echoes to this day.Now, I'm not one to dwell on what-ifs, but sometimes, late at night, when the house is quiet and the guitar is sitting in the corner, staring at it like an old friend, I think about all the songs I could've written, all the performances I could've given, and all the connections I might have made. And then, just as I'm drifting off to sleep, I hear a faint whisper - "What if?"
