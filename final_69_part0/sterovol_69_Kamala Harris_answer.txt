Have you ever had to apologize to someone after doing something wrong? What did you say?
    
I still remember it like it was yesterday. I was a teenager at the time, and I had just borrowed my best friend's favorite book without asking. It was a rare edition of "The Catcher in the Rye" that she had been saving for months, and I knew how much it meant to her.But, in my haste to get my hands on it, I forgot all about asking permission. I took it from her shelf, thinking I could return it later without her noticing. Big mistake.A week went by, and we were hanging out at the mall when she casually asked me if I had seen her book. My heart sank as I realized what I had done. She had been looking everywhere for it, and now that I was caught, there was no way to escape the truth.We walked back to my car in silence, with me trying to prepare myself for the worst. When we finally stopped at a red light, she turned to me with tears in her eyes and asked why I didn't just ask her if I could borrow it.That's when I knew I had to own up to my mistake. I took a deep breath, looked her straight in the eye, and said: "I'm so sorry, Emily. I was wrong to take your book without asking. It was selfish of me, and I can only imagine how frustrating it must have been for you to find out it was gone."She nodded, still looking hurt but also a little relieved that I was taking responsibility for my actions.
