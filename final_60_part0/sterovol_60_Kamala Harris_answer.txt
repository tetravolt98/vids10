Have you ever had to make an embarrassing phone call? How did you recover?
    
Yes! I'm still cringing thinking about it. It was a few years ago when I accidentally booked my best friend's bachelor party at a male revue club in Vegas instead of the private poker room he had requested. Let me tell you, that guy loves his poker nights and was not amused.The phone call to book the event had been a quick, loud discussion on a crowded street with one of his groomsmen, and I'd missed some crucial details. When my friend called me in a panic, asking what had happened, I knew I had to own up to the mistake ASAP.I swallowed hard, took a deep breath, and dialed him back. He answered with a gruff "What now?" and I just... launched into it. "Dude, I'm so sorry. I made this huge mistake." There was an awkward silence on the other end before he finally spoke up."What kind of 'huge' mistake?" he asked, his tone slowly shifting from anger to curiosity. That's when things started to get really interesting...I took a deep breath and told him everything â€“ the phone call, the male revue club, the potential embarrassment that was about to ensue. His response? A laugh so loud it echoed through the room. "Dude, this is gonna be legendary."
