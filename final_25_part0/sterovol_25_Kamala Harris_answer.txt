Have you ever had a secret crush on someone for years? What finally happened?
    
It's embarrassing to admit it now, but I did have a secret crush on Frida Kahlo for years. It started when I stumbled upon her artwork in an old art book my grandmother left behind. I must've been 10 or 11 at the time, and something about those vibrant colors and the intensity of her emotions just resonated with me.As I grew older, my fascination with Frida only deepened. I devoured books about her life, scoured the internet for any tidbit of information I could find, and even started a sketchbook to try and capture some of the same raw emotion in my own art. My friends would tease me mercilessly, calling me "Frida's biggest fan" or joking that I must've been a girl from her school (much to my chagrin).But what they didn't know was that I'd also started following every Frida-related event and exhibition within a 500-mile radius. When I heard she was going to be the subject of an upcoming documentary, I knew I had to attend. And so, on a crisp autumn morning in New York City, I found myself waiting outside a small film festival screening room... alongside none other than Carlos Slim Hel√∫, Frida's great-nephew!Now, here's where things get interesting: as we exchanged awkward hellos and introductions, he leaned over and whispered something to me that made my heart skip a beat. Do you think I should follow up on the hint he dropped about Frida's long-forgotten love letters?
