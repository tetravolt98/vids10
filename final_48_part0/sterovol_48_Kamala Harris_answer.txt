What's the most impressive thing that's happened in your life recently?
    
I'd have to say it was when I met Frida Kahlo at a small art studio in Mexico City. It sounds crazy, but it actually happened just last month! I had been visiting the city for work and stumbled upon this tiny little place tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. I wandered in out of curiosity, and that's where I found her - sitting at an easel, painting with vibrant colors and what looked like a mixture of passion and frustration on her face.At first, I thought she was just another artist working away, but as I watched her paint, I noticed the way the light danced across her features, and I felt this inexplicable sense of connection to her. The next thing I knew, she was speaking directly to me in perfect Spanish, asking what brought me to her studio that day.Before I could even process what was happening, she invited me into her life for a few hours - literally! She took me on a whirlwind tour of the city, showing me hidden corners and secret spots that only locals know about. We talked about everything from art and politics to love and loss. It was like we'd known each other our entire lives.But what really blew my mind was when she pulled out an old sketchbook from her bag and started flipping through its yellowed pages... only to reveal some of the most incredible sketches I've ever seen! They were raw, unbridled energy on paper - a testament to the turbulent life she'd lived. As I looked at those drawings, I felt like I was witnessing something truly special.And then, just as suddenly as it began, the day was over...
